    <h1>Rogelia the Cat</h1>
    <p>Rogelia is a stray cat in our small village. I seldom see her with small pack of stray cats strolling the village, sniffing every trash bins in the neighbors looking for food. One day, she approached me as came out of the house with a
    trash bag. She quietly sit and waited until i put everything in the trash bin, I knew her gang is likely nearby and worried they will mess with our trash when I leave so I fix the lid of the bin tightly, as I do this, Rogelia keeps on sighing
    "meoww", "meoww", "meoww" until I went back inside, as I close the gate Rogelia looks at me and say "meowww" one more time. I knew she must be hungry, so I check our refrigerator and look for some left-over, took it and bring it outside.
    As I open the gate, I saw Rogelia still sitting in the same spot waiting for me as if certain I'm going back to give her something to eat.</p>

    <p>This is a long story, I'll try to finish while learning to code.</p>
