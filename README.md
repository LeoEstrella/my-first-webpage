_This Project contains practice lessons from [**Epicodus**](https://www.epicodus.com), as this is my first attempt to learn to code one might expect to see only simple and basic commands._
## _Programming Languages I'm hoping to learn from this are the following_
* html
* CSS
* Javascript
* And a lot more..
